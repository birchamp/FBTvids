    title: "Can we translate the Bible?",
    discussion: `Now that you have watched the video, here are some questions to think about and discuss:

• Why did the Tano want the Bible in their own language instead of the trade language they were already using? (possible answer: They found the words in the trade language Bible confusing)
  - Discussion questions:
    • Do the people in your language understand the trade language Bible? How well do most people understand it?
    • Do you think you need a Bible in your language? If so why do you want a Bible in your own language?
    • Are there particular words in the trade language that your people struggle to understand?

• What did the church leaders do as a result of this need? (possible answer: They prayed for God to help them understand the word and strengthen the church)
  - Discussion question: How have your church leaders addressed your language's need for the Bible?

• What were believers in Mai doing? (possible answer: They were translating the Bible into their own language)
  - Discussion questions:

  - Discussion question: How do you feel being told that you are going to produce your own translation rather than have someone help you or translate it for you?

• How did the Mai leaders reassured the Tano? (possible answers: They said they felt the same at the beginning, but that God was with them in their work and that they did not need special permission to do this work since it was of God. They also offered to work alongside the Tano to help them.)
  - Discussion questions:
    • Have people discouraged you from producing a translation work on your own?
    • What have been their reasons on why producing a translation on your own is not a good idea?

  - Discussion question: Have you experienced similar problems when you have translated the Bible for yourself?

• What did the Tano find most difficult about their translation? (possible answers: They had a hard time understanding the word-for-word translation in their own language; the words were in the Tano language, but did not sound natural.)
  - Discussion questions:
    • What are some examples of how you need to change the word order of your language from the trade language for it to sound natural?
    • Are there words you need to add for sentences to make sense or that the trade language uses that you don't need?

• How were they able to improve the translation? (possible answer: They kept the meaning the same, but used Tano forms.)
  - Discussion question: Are there ways you know you are going to have to change the forms of the resource or trade language for it to sound good or for the meaning to make sense in your language?

• What were some of the things that affected the form of the language? (possible answer: The number of words, the order of words, etc.)

• How were the Tano able to change the form but make sure they meaning stayed the same? (possible answer: They would check to see that nothing is added, nothing is missing, and nothing is changed)
  - Discussion question: Are there any sayings or expressions in your language that would not make any sense if you translated them literally into English (fill in your trade language)?`
